# Deck of Cards Problem Statement

Your assignment is to code a set of classes that represent a deck of poker-style playing cards.
(Fifty-two playing cards in four suits: hearts, spades, clubs, diamonds, with face values of Ace,
2-10, Jack, Queen, and King.)

Within one of your classes, you must provide two operations:

1. shuffle() Shuffle returns no value, but results in the cards in the deck being randomly
permuted. Please do not use library-provided “shuffle” operations to implement this function.
You may use library provided random number generators in your solution if needed.

2. dealOneCard() This function should return one card from the deck to the caller. Specifically, a
call to shuffle followed by 52 calls to dealOneCard() should result in the caller being provided all
52 cards of the deck in a random order. If the caller then makes a 53rd call dealOneCard(), no
card is dealt.

Many details of this assignment have been left intentionally vague.

Follow the principle of least surprise in making reasonable decisions regarding the
implementation. While this is a trivial assignment, pretend that this code will become a
foundational part of a new product.Take whatever measures you feel are required for
your code to meet this bar. We are not concerned with how quickly you complete this
assignment.
Take your time and do it right!
